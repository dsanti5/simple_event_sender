                    <h2>Editions</h2>
                    <p>Regarding editions/releases and staying up to date, the application has a way to automatically download
                        the latest repository from git and extracting schemas (<a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel">https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel</a>). To
                        ensure compatibility with more releases than the latest one, the editions on
                        <a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases">https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases</a>
                        must be updated in a similar way (regular git repository),
                        or there is no way to generalize the download since we do not know the download links or release names beforehand.</p>
                    <p>To generalize the handling of all editions, we recommend one of the following two options: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Handling of old versions could be done using the git repository that exists today,
                            the problem is that we have no way of knowing which schema belongs to which release (for example if version 2.0.0 belongs to toulouse,
                            bordeaux or agen in /schemas/SomeEiffelEvent). In order to solve this, the naming convention of the releases could be changed – meaning
                            that in each release, all schemas get +1 in version, regardless if they actually were changed or not. Then it would be very easy to
                            match the events to old releases (for example if there was a new edition released, all schemas would be updated to 5.0.0) </li>
                        <li>Generalize the page which posts new editions (<a href="https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases">
                            https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/releases</a>) with a convention for the new link/edition names.
                            Since the newer releases (Agen, Agen-1) only contain the relevant schemas, it will be easy to match correctly between
                            editions and schemas going forward.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Function to download new editions that are published on github exists, but has not been tested to guarantee full functionality to editions other than the required edition Agen-1. This functionality can be further developed to automatically support new editions.

                        To ensure better compatibility between the Event Sender’s function to download protocols and the Eiffel Protocol on github, we recommend that the
                        edition file on githib is structured in a way so that it is clear which meta.version for which event belongs to which edition.
                        As of today, several meta.version for every event type are included in the newer editions. </p>
                    <h2>Lookup</h2>
                    <p> The Look up function is built to support more look ups than the three specified in the SRS, but these additional
                        targets have not been tested and full functionality for additional look up targets can therefore not be guaranteed by us.
                        By building on the existing functionality, the look up function can be able to cover more allowed look up targets than the
                        one specified in the SRS. Specifically, validation of allowed targets should be further developed to control event type, link
                        type and link target combinations and to work in older editions that Agen-1.</p>
                    <h2>Customizing the Eiffel Protocol</h2>
                    <p>Since the Event Sender acts as a filter between the client and the message bus it could thus be used as a tool to add customized
                        to the Eiffel Protocol without changing the protocol in itself. New rules could be added on how the parameters work, what links are
                        allowed in the look up and the Eiffel protocol could be overruled if wanted. This becomes an opportunity to add customized features
                        to Eiffel while maintaining the Eiffel protocol the same and instead releasing new versions of the Event Sender. </p>
                    <h2>Parameters</h2>
                    <p>The two parameters AllowSeveralMatches (ASM) and AllowMissingMatch (AMM) are both link specific, this means that in order to set one
                        of them or both for all links in one event, the client has to set ASM and AMM to the desired value for each look up. Adding two “umbrella”
                        parameters would allow the client to set the values for all look up with one parameter. These two parameters could be added to the JSON parameter
                        object and to overrule all link specific ASM and AMM. </p>
